## Introduction



Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are essential for topographic and geomorphological studies. However, voids in DEMs cause loss of terrain details and reduce their applicability.

Traditional interpolation methods degrade in accuracy and struggle with complex terrain. GAN-based methods improve performance but are prone to artifacts and elevation jumps near voids.

We propose a **Terrain Feature-Guided Diffusion Model (TFDM)** for DEM void filling. By constraining the diffusion process with terrain feature lines, TFDM generates seamless DEM surfaces and preserves terrain contours.

## Training

Train the diffusion model with:

```bash
python train.py --conf_path confs/train.yml
```

---

## Testing & Evaluation

Run evaluation on test DEMs:

```bash
python test.py --conf_path confs/dem_eval.yml
```
